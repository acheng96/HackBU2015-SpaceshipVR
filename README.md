Inspired by the Spaceteam mobile app, SpaceshipVR is an interactive virtual reality game that requires players to perform different actions on a control panel to earn points. The game combines the motion and gesture sensing of the Myo armband and the 3D environment of the Oculus Rift. The project was completed at HackBU 2015 over the course of 36 hours using the Unity software and the C# programming language.
